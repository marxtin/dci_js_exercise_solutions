# Arrays and Basic Array Methods

Small exercise to practice the methods we learned today

1. Declare a variable named "euroCities" and assign an array to the variable e.g. ["Paris", "London", "Valletta", "Prague", "Rome"]. Declare another variable and assign the second item of the array as a value.

2. Change the first item in the array to "Berlin".

3. Print the length of the array "euroCities".

4. Remove the last item of the array "euroCities". 

5. Use an array method to add "Budapest" to the euroCities array. 

6. Use an array method to delete one element from the array. Save this element in another variable.

7. Add 3 cities with one single array method. Save the new length of the array in another variable.
