# Programming Baics: Objects Practice


#### 1. Creating objects
Create an object that will contain the information of your favorite city. The object must contain the following properties: name, country, population, language, area, weatherInfo, elevation.
After creating the object use `console.log()` to display each property separately 

#### 2. Accessing objects
For this task you will use the city object you created before. Create a function that will accept 2 arguments, one is the city object and another with a string. The string will contain the name of a property. 
The function must return a message containing the information about the property selected and the property of the object:

```js
console.log(giveProperty(cityObject, "area")) // -> "The area of Hamburg is: 755.2 square kilometers"
```

#### 3. Creating objects with functions
Create a function that will receive the information about an user. The information received in the arguments are: username, age and email. The function will take these arguments and return an object with this information as properties.
