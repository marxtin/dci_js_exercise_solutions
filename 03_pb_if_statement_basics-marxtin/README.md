# Programming Basics: Conditionals

These exercises are aimed at making you more comfortable with using conditionals as well as operators. Use "if" statements to complete the following exercises. Print your results to the console.

1. Check if two given integer values are in the range 50 to 99 (this includes both 50 and 99). Print true if either of them are in the range.

2. Check if three given integer values are in the range 50 to 99 (inclusive). Print true if one or more of them are in the range.

3. Check if the given string begins with "Py", if true print the given string if false add "Py" at the beginning of the string.

4. Calculate the sum of the two integers. If the sum is in the range 50 to 80, print 65, otherwise print 80. 

5. Check whether the sum of two integers is 8. If this is the case, print true.

6. Check whether either one of two integers is 15, or if their sum is 15. If one of these is the case, print true. 

7. Check whether one of two integers is a multiple of 7 or 11. If so, print true.

8. Calculate the sum of the two given integers. If the two values are the same, then print triple their sum. 

9. BONUS CHALLENGE:  Make a variable for firstName and age and give each variable values. Create an if/else statement to check whether the person's age is less than 13. If so, print "firstName is a child". If the age is equal to or more than 13 and less than 20, print "firstName is a teenager". If the person's age is equal to and more than 20 and less than 30, then print "firstName is a young adult". If none of these conditions apply, print "firstName is a adult". 

10. RESEARCH CHALLENGE: Play around with each of your results, i.e., make sure they are dynamic to different inputs; is there a more efficient way of writing your code?; etc. (*Hint:* search for ternary)
