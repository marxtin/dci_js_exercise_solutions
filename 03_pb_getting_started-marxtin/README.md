# CONSOLE.LOG EXERCISES: Getting Started 

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with using node to run your scripts & the console.log method. For each exercise, run your script in node to check if your console.log(s) are working. Remember to use camelCase where needed.

## Task 1

Create a JavaScript file and work from there. Open up your terminal in VS Code.  

**Instructions**

2. Print the phrase `Hello World`. Make sure to run your javascript file in node. 
3. Print another phrase e.g. `This is my first js file`. 
4. Comment out your second statement. 

**Questions: Write your answers as a block comment in the js file**
1. Remove a parenthesis from the first statement and run the code. Does your statement print? 
2. Is there an error? If so, what kind of error is it?  

## Task 2 

Create another JavaScript file and work from there. Open up your terminal in VS Code.  

**Instructions**

1. Console log a line of text eg. "this is an exercise in console logging" (do not forget quotation marks). 

2. Declare a variable and give your variable the following value: "This is the value.". Console log your **variable**. 

3. Declare a variable called firstName and assign your first name to that variable. Do the same with your last name. Console log both variables. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);

4. Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. name, city, job etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables. 

5. Print a sentence using the profile variables above, adding text where necessary for sentence flow, i.e., "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin". **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);** 

## Task 3

These tasks are aimed at making you more comfortable with solving math problems using JS. **Print each of your results to the console.**
Create a third JavaScript file and work from there. Open up your terminal in VS Code. Separate each of the questions by comments

**Average** 

Q10. The number of hours Noemy worked over the last two weeks are 8, 6, 5, 9, 8, 2, 1, 8.5, 7, 4
What is Noemy's average hours worked per day?

Q11. A math student scored 75, 70, 85, 90, 100 on the first five tests he took . After he took his sixth math test, the average is now 85. What did he score on the sixth test?
Expected output: Score in the sixth test: --.

Q12. For James to get a 1st class degree, he needs to get an average of 80% in all 9 of his assessments. He has taken 8 assessments and his average is 78%. What is the minimum percentage he must get in his last assessment to ensure he gets a first class? 
Expected output: James needs a minimum of --% to get an 80% average.
